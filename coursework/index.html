        <h2>Rules and description of the game</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Tic-tac-toe</b> is a game for two players who take turns marking
          the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who
          succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
          diagonal row is the winner.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rule 1: The game takes place in a 3x3 field.</li>
          <li>
            Rule 2: The game involves two players (in this case - the user and
            the computer).
          </li>
          <li>Rule 3: Players take turns taking turns.</li>
          <li>Rule 4: The player playing Xs starts first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Two buttons are available in the game - Restart and Undo.</p>
        <p>Restart* - starts the game from the beginning.</p>
        <p>
          Undo* - undoes one last move of each player (however, it does not work
          after the end of the game, that is, the announcement of the winner).
