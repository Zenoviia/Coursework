### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a coursework for the "Fundamentals of Programming, Part 2" course. It features a classic tic-tac-toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Features:

- **Gameplay**: Two players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O (in this case, one player is the user, and the other is the computer).
- **Restart Button**: Allows players to start the game over.
- **Undo Button**: Enables players to cancel the last move (more precisely - two, one move by player X and one move by 0).
- **Information Button**: Found in the upper right corner, it displays the rules and description of the game when clicked. The window can be closed by pressing the "X" button or using the Esc key.
- **Cell Highlighting**: After filling a cell with X or O, its filling becomes darker, providing visual feedback.

This project was created by Zenoviia Tkachenko from the IM-31 group.
